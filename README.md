# oracle-aws-rman
Migrated an on-premise Oracle database to an EC2-hosted Oracle server in AWS. Implemented automated RMAN backup using Bash and Python scripts to store daily backups in Amazon S3. The Oracle EC2 instance is hosted in a private subnet with access configured via a bastion (jump) server.

# Oracle RMAN Backup Automation to AWS S3

This project automates Oracle RMAN backups and uploads them to Amazon S3, running on an EC2-hosted Oracle server in a private subnet.

## üöÄ Project Overview

- **Migration**: Migrated an on-premise Oracle database to an EC2 instance in AWS.
- **Architecture**: Oracle EC2 hosted in a **private subnet**, accessed securely via a **bastion (jump) server**.
- **Backup Automation**:
  - Used **RMAN** to take Oracle database backups.
  - Wrote **Bash** and **Python scripts** to handle the backup and upload.
  - Backups are stored automatically in an **S3 bucket**.
- **Automation**: Set up a **cron job** to run the backup and upload script daily.
- **Validation**: Verified backup upload in the S3 bucket and maintained logging.
