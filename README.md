# oracle-aws-rman
Migrated an on-premise Oracle database to an EC2-hosted Oracle server in AWS. Implemented automated RMAN backup using Bash and Python scripts to store daily backups in Amazon S3. The Oracle EC2 instance is hosted in a private subnet with access configured via a bastion (jump) server.
